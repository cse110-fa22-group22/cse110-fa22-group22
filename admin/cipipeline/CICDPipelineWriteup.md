## CI/CD Pipeline Phase 1

# Pipeline Reasoning
- We want to implement the following tasks in the section below for our pipeline so that we are able to check the code that is being merged and make sure it is clean and neat and held to a standard. Using the features we list below we can continue development (CI) so that we have no hold ups in the development process.

# Identified 5 Pipeline Features
- linting and code style enforcement (may happen in pipeline and/or in editor)
- code quality via tool  (ex. Codeclimate, Codacy, etc.)
- code quality via human review (ex. Pull Requests)
- unit tests via automation (ex. Jest, Tape, Ava, Cypress, Mocha/Chai, etc.)*
- documentation generation via automation (ex. JSDocs)

We have the following Pipeline Diagram
