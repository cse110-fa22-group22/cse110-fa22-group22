# Team 22 CI/CD Pipeline

## Overview 

Our pipeline is designed to quickly and effenciently deploy new code while testing it for bugs. We have the following tools and processes outlined for our pipeline.

### Linting
We are using **ESLint** to keep our javascript error-free and standardize our coding conventions.

**Methods of using ESLint:**
1. Install ESLint extension on VSCode for live error scan. We recommended everyone on our team to install this extension so we can view the error live and practice our coding conventions more efficiently.

2. Run `npm run lint` in terminal. We also implemented lint in our npm scripts so it can scan the appropiate folders and files.
