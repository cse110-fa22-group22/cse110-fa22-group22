## New Developments
- After going over the retrospective meeting, we all like the way we developed during sprint #2 so we want to keep this pace and keep this open channel of communication so that issues are getting worked on and solved. 

## Unresolved Business?
- 

## Additional Information / Comments
- UI Change #1: Fixing buttons for update and delete. Make sure they always fall under the bottom line so it looks good for text wrapping
- Color of purple changes to blue for the "add to shopping list" if we have shopping list as a blue color.
- Do UI fixes and enhancements.
- Same teams for inventory as shopping list and get to development ASAP.
- Finish inventory and get to work on UI enhancements. 


## Important Notes / Decisions
- Should be done with Development by Sunday December 4th so we have ample time to test and fix bugs and UI/UX elements.
