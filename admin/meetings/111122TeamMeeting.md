1. Pipeline Tasks defined by Navya

    - jsdocs for documentation [what is js docs?](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/jsdoc-documentation/) Professor went over this in class as well this week. Refer to slides for more detailed info. Ideally, everyone will complete JS docs for their own PRs.

 2. Division of pipeline tasks
 3. Development flow (Everyone already knows this but I wanted to quickly cover it)
    - Pull the latest changes
    - make a local branch
    - make changes
    - do unit testing after feature is completed and create JS Docs simultaneously
    - Commit and push the changes - have meaningful commit messages and also commit your code consistently
    - Raise a Pull Request - add detailed description of the changes that are made, all the people who contributed to the development and test of that feature and also a link to the GitHub issues that this feature is solving
    - Review code
    - Resolve conflicts and Merge the code - merge only if there 2/3 reviews and approvals and all the comments are resolved
    - Do integration testing - after first stage of development is done
    - Updates on the project progress - what is completed and what is the plan for next week. Please plan to demo the progress in the next week's meeting. The next thing on our TODO list is the shopping list feature
    - Testing needs to be done as you finish each feature. You can only to final integration testing later but each feature wise testing must be done as and when you develop. Start the unit tests and writing JS docs now.
