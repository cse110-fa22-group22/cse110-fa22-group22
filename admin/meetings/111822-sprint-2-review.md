## New Developments
- We want to start early and finish early according to retrospective meeting. We are going to be on top of deadlines and try and define the requisites of the various aspects of the project better. 
- We want to make sure that we are scheduling more meetings so the team is able to develop together as a team more rather than individual efforts. So during this sprint, we will aim to develop together as a team with a lot more communication between who is doing what aspect and coordinating times to develop so that everyone is free.
