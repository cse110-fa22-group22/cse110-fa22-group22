Event Update Page - Used for students to find events at school since there are so many events and unoficial events that students would want to look at and maybe participate in.

Stockroom Arrangement List - Whenever you go shopping and buy a lot of stuffs but you don’t really remember if you bought it yet or not, the list will help you know you have the stuffs in your stock or not. Moreover, this list can show you where you arrange your stuffs at home

Shopping List - Shopping list for people to update what they are looking to shop for, what they have already gotten, etc..
Notes app - Simple CRUD app for people to create notes. 

## Important Notes / Decisions
- What is the local aspect of the app vs the remote aspect? And does this have to do with the user’s data and how we are storing it? What does “Arch: Local first, remote second” mean.
- What is our app allowed to do in terms of internet? Should our app be solely reliable on the internet or should it work without flaw even without internet access. Should the data for the user be stored locally or should it be stored on the cloud?

- Meeting we will decided after insight from Navya
