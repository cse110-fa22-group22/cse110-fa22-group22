Smart shopping and inventory management web app

We did a survey and found out that every day people have a problem of impulsive purchasing of products they don’t need or REpurchasing products that they already have which results in overspending and an increase of food and product waste.

Our goal is to enable our users to manage their inventory and shopping list better from anywhere at any time.

The 2 main features are shopping list, inventory, and 1 secondary feature suggestion for shopping list. This is jack, he will demonstrate this app. 

We have completed the shopping list features and are working on the inventory features which Jack will demo.

Next Retrospectively
Through the development process
We noticed that the team was struggling with setting up a simultaneous development structure, because the project is a single page web app. We resolved this by structuring our project to be able to import and export methods from different files so that everyone is able to work on their specific feature in their designated file without having conflicts in development.

We were overwhelmed trying to explore and implement the tools for the CI pipeline. However, with the resources provided by our TA, Navya, and collaboration between the team. We are in the process of integrating more tools as we find necessary. Currently, we have eslint, csslint, Jest, and JSDocs integrated into our CI pipeline.

Other than that, our team is really excited and enjoy the progress we’ve made thus far on the app, and they have noted that they like the amount of communication and collaboration that the team has and how everyone has been actively involved in the project and supportive. 

What we will do in the future
We have fully finished the shopping list portion and we are working on implementing a similar functionality for our inventory management system. We will implement the create, read, update, delete function for the inventory followed by a feature for giving users suggestions on things to add to their shopping list. We plan to have this all done by December 4th, allowing us 3 days to fully end2end test and make sure all the various bugs and aspects of UI UX is ironed out.
