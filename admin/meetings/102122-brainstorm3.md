## Agenda Items 
1. Go over 3 ideas
2. Narrow in on one of the ideas
3. Go over roles for the idea  
4. Go over the look for the idea and etc... (Ideas / Notes)

## Ideas / Notes
- Competitors: Sticky Notes / Notes
  
- Color/Theme: Green / Purple / Yellow / White / Black - Homegood vibes (like you walk into the home aisle of Macy's)
   
- Mood/Metaphor: Homegood Vibes 
  
- Features (With priority): 
  1. BASICS: CRUD (1. Create, 2. Read, 4. Update, 3. Delete)
  2. Categories for items (Allows for ease of user experience to quickly catalog certain items)
  3. Icons for the items (Allows for user to see what they have quickly - ease of experience)
  4. Shopping list of what to get (This will allow for a quick add to inventory when the shopping trip has completed)
  5. Storage space list (Allows user to see where the item is in their home)
  
- Target Audience: Moms, Chefs, Students, Home-owners, butlers, people who buy grocerries - essentially people who need to organize their homes and figure out the items they have and what they need. Once they get what they need they can add it to their app and it will add it to their inventory. 
  
- What do users want? Users want an app that will allow them to organize their homes and take into account items they already have or have bought on previous trips to the store.
