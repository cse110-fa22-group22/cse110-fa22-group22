Hey guys,
Navya reached out to Varun and I emphasizing that we should divide into two teams: one for pitch/documentation (team 1) and the other for pipeline (team 2).
Additionally, team 1 will handle half of the pitch and team 2 will handle the other half. 
The teams are as follows:

Varun: Yahui, Paul, Subash (Documentation / Pitch) 

Mustansir: Jack, Zijian, Ahn, Stephen (Pipeline)

Team 1 (Pitch / Features / Explanation / Documentation)
1. Problem, solution, features and their priorities, why the features are chosen
2. User personas, user stories
3. Statement of purpose for building this website and for selecting the features that you did
4. Anything else you have done as a part of brainstorming, user interviews, or competitor app analysis could be included in a section of the pitch 
5.  Roadmap of your project
6.  Risks, Rabbit holes, and No gos


Team 2 (Diagramming / Wireframing):
 1. Technologies you would use for the backend and front end
 2. System diagrams (Refer to brainstorming canvas assignment for references)
 3. Wireframes (Ref: https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-is-a-wireframe-guide/)
 4. Pipeline

To be clear, these teams are fluid and play no role in the actual coding. This is just for us to divide out some of the pitch tasks and other non technical aspects of the project
