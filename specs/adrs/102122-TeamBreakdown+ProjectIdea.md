[Note: The team has changed a little in terms of breakdown from our document at](admin/../101022-TeamBreakdownDecision.md)

Problem: Need to narrow focus on what we want out of the application we build.

Options Considered: Inventory Management, Notes App, Shopping list

Driving Factors: We ended up combining the 3 of these essentially into one product where we can have users shop and then add things to their inventory while they shop and as they are done with their shopping trip. This is why we narroed down on the Inventory Management idea. 
 
- Check Notes section for ideas based on the app and how we want it to look like.
