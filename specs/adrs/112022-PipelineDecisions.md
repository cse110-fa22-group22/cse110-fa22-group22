Problem: Need to get linting, JSDocs, and CI pipeline fully set up. Decide on which tools to implement and how to do it.

Decision: Use CSSLint, ESlint, JSDocs, and implement this in GitHub actions and have Jack and Mustansir go over these with the team to demonstrate how they work and how they should be used properly. 

Driving Factors: We wanted to use simple and easy tools for the team, so that we can just comment and create documention as well as have our github actions check the pushes automatically to ensure that the code is neat and organized and proper. 

Outcomes: Implemented CSSLint, ESLint, and JSDocs and did a demonstration for team to get everyone on board and familiar.
