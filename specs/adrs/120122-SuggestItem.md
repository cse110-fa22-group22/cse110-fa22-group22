Problem: Deciding on where the suggst item button should be placed.

Options Considered: On button for both list or two button with one for each list

Driving Factors: We were debating on what option would be more aestetic and/or intuitive. When we initialy created this feature we had a single button but specifically on one section. The button was not completely done so this decision needed to be made for continuing with feature.

Outcomes
Pro: Only one button so less visual clutter
Con: Possible that some user would rather prefer two buttons
