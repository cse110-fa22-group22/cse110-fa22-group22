Problem: Should we add a clear button to quickly clear out the inventory and shopping list?

Options Considered: Yes / No

Driving Factors / Pro and Cons: Time crunch given that we only have 2 days before the final video and we want to make sure that the features and website are bug free and completely working without adding extra features such as a clear button. The clear button, although useful and very helpful, would potentially add a lot of bugs and is something we don't want to work on giving us more bugs and errors - If it ain't broke don't fix it. 

Outcomes: We did not end up adding the clear button.
