Problem: We want to create a user guide for how each button works so that a user can easily perform the functions.  

Options Considered: Buttons with a legend

Driving Factors: Makes it easier to look at. The guide at the top is easy to understand the first try through so then from then on the buttons are easy to understand. 

Outcomes
Pro: Easy for user still. Looks good. 
Con: User has 1 extra step of understanding, but then from then on the site looks better
