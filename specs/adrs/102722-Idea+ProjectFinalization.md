## Important Notes / Decisions
- [Changed idea more geared towards shopping list](/specs/adrs/102122-TeamBreakdown%2BProjectIdea.md)
- Finished the presentations and diagram, now we just have to present.

Problem: Get teams split and organize who does what in terms of development for the app. These are all based on each individual's preferences. Also change the gear towards shopping list

Determining Factors: We were looking at how we wanted to implement the inventory, and we realized that shopping list was the essential feature we need to complete and get narrowed in on. 

Pro: We understand what we need to do in terms of roadmap and development stages. We understand that shopping list is essential and that we need to get that delivered.

Cons: We have to shift the plan slightly, so will take some time in terms of maneuvering everything towards shopping list rather than inventory. Small con. Pro >> 

Hey guys,
Navya reached out to Varun and I emphasizing that we should divide into two teams: one for pitch/documentation (team 1) and the other for pipeline (team 2).
Additionally, team 1 will handle half of the pitch and team 2 will handle the other half. 

The teams are as follows:

Varun: Yahui, Paul, Subash (Documentation / Pitch) 

Mustansir: Jack, Zijian, Ahn, Stephen (Pipeline)

Team 1 (Pitch / Features / Explanation / Documentation)
1. Problem, solution, features and their priorities, why the features are chosen
2. User personas, user stories
3. Statement of purpose for building this website and for selecting the features that you did
4. Anything else you have done as a part of brainstorming, user interviews, or competitor app analysis could be included in a section of the pitch 
5.  Roadmap of your project
6.  Risks, Rabbit holes, and No gos


Team 2 (Diagramming / Wireframing):
 1. Technologies you would use for the backend and front end
 2. System diagrams (Refer to brainstorming canvas assignment for references)
 3. Wireframes (Ref: https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-is-a-wireframe-guide/)
 4. Pipeline

To be clear, these teams are fluid and play no role in the actual coding. This is just for us to divide out some of the pitch tasks and other non technical aspects of the project
